## Quickstart with a HelloWorld Example

### Android

[HelloWorld](https://github.com/pytorch/android-demo-app/tree/master/HelloWorldApp) is a simple image classification application that demonstrates how to use PyTorch Android API.
This application runs TorchScript serialized TorchVision pretrained resnet18 model on static image which is packaged inside the app as android asset.


### iOS

To get started with PyTorch on iOS, we recommend exploring the following [HelloWorld](https://github.com/pytorch/ios-demo-app/tree/master/HelloWorld).

HelloWorld is a simple image classification application that demonstrates how to use PyTorch C++ libraries on iOS. The code is written in Swift and uses Objective-C as a bridge.

# Getting Started

To get started, you can warch the following videos by PyTorch Partner Engineer Brad Heintz, who walks through steps for setting up the PyTorch Runtime for Android and iOS projects:

## Android

* The corresponding code can be found **[here](https://github.com/pytorch/workshops/tree/master/PTMobileWalkthruAndroid)**.
* Checkout our **[Mobile Performance Recipes](../performance/mobile_perf)** which cover how to optimize your model and check if optimizations helped via benchmarking.
* In addition, follow this recipe to learn how to **[make Native Android Application that use PyTorch prebuilt libraries](../building/android_native_app_with_custom_op)**.


## iOS
